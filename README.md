# Simone
This is a GitHub of Leslie Hochsztein's Project 1 Simon game for GA WDI 7 in Atlanta.

## Overview
For Project 1, I created a Simon game.  But instead of Simon, Simone tells you what to do!

Simone is a one-player game. When the player comes to the site, he or she sees a game board and a start button.  Once the player hits the start button, the game lights up a random button.  The player must remember which button lit up and click it.  The game then re-lights the first button, followed by another random button.  The user then must click the sequence in the right order as one more additional random button lights up each round.
The game ends when the user clicks an incorrect button in the sequence.
The user then has the option to restart the game from round one again. The game will produce a completely different random sequence each game.
